Corn

1 can sweet corn
1 can creamed corn
1 box jiffy cornbread mix
1 stick butter
1 8oz package cream cheese

I almost always make a double batch. Single batch fits a square pan, double batch fits a rectangular pan.

Preheat oven to 375 or 400 or 350. Ish. 

Soften the butter and cream cheese if you're feeling fancy. Open everything and pour into a bowl. Do not drain the cans first. Mix loosely.

Pour into greased pan. Bake for around an hour, or until golden brown.
